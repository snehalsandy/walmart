# Walmart_Kaggle_Competition
Kaggle competition hosted by Walmart -  machine learning classification with python


Walmart uses both art and science to continually make progress on their core mission of better understanding and serving their customers. One way Walmart is able to improve customers' shopping experiences is by segmenting their store visits into different trip types. 

Whether they're on a last minute run for new puppy supplies or leisurely making their way through a weekly grocery list, classifying trip types enables Walmart to create the best shopping experience for every customer.

Currently, Walmart's trip types are created from a combination of existing customer insights ("art") and purchase history data ("science"). In their third recruiting competition, Walmart is challenging Kagglers to focus on the (data) science and classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they've purchased. Improving the science behind trip type classification will help Walmart refine their segmentation process.

Walmart is hosting this competition to connect with data scientists who break the mold.
